TIFF File Header 
The 8-byte TIFF file header contains the following information:

Bytes 0-1: The byte order used within the file. Legal values are:“II”(4949.H)“MM” (4D4D.H).

In the “II” format, byte order is always from the least significant byte to the most significant byte, 
for both 16-bit and 32-bit integers This is called little-endian byte order. 
In the “MM” format, byte order is always from most significant to least significant, 
for both 16-bit and 32-bit integers. This is called big-endian byte order.

Bytes 2-3: An arbitrary but carefully chosen number (42) that further identifies the file as a TIFF file.
The byte order depends on the value of Bytes 0-1.

Bytes 4-7:  The offset (in bytes) of the first IFD. The directory may be at any location in the file after 
the header but must begin on a word boundary. In particular, an Image File Directory may follow the image data it describes. 
Readers must follow the pointers wherever they may lead.The term byte offset is always used in this document to refer to 
a location with respect to the beginning of the TIFF file. The first byte of the file has an offset of 0.

IFD Entry 
Each 12-byte IFD Entry is in the following format.

Bytes	Description
0-1	The Tag that identifies the field
2-3	The field type
4-7	Count of the indicated type
8-11	The Value Offset, the file offset (in bytes) of the Value for the field.The Value is expected to begin on a word boundary; 
the correspond-ing Value Offset will thus be an even number. This file offset may point anywhere in the file, even after the image data
